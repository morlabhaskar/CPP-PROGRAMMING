## Overview

This repository contains C++ programs that focus on:

- Object-oriented programming  
- Memory management  
- STL containers and algorithms  
- Templates and generic programming  
- Embedded-friendly low-level concepts  

It is designed to help build strong foundations for **system programming**, **competitive coding**, and **embedded firmware development using modern C++**.

---

## Purpose

The main objectives of this repository are to:

- Build a **strong foundation in modern C++ (C++11–C++20)**
- Practice **problem-solving** and algorithmic thinking
- Strengthen **OOP concepts** such as inheritance and polymorphism
- Master **STL containers, iterators, and algorithms**
- Understand **pointers, references, dynamic memory, RAII, and smart pointers**
- Practice **bitwise operations, memory layout, and embedded-oriented patterns**
- Prepare for **system-level development**, microcontrollers, and firmware programming
